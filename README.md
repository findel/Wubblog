# Wubblog #

*Wubblog* is (or will be) a lightweight blogging solution built using 
ASP.NET, NancyFx, Simple.Data and MySql.

It's not intended to be an 'engine' like project which would be installed and receive updates, 
but rather a 'starter' project for you to build on top of by yourself.

Of course, if you want to receive updates from the upstream (if and when they are made), 
you can fork the project and maintain you're own version in a seperate branch. 
You'll be entirely in control of (and responsible for) merging changes into your own branch.
